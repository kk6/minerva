# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Test/Lint Commands
- Install dependencies: `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- Run all tests: `uv run pytest`
- Run single test: `uv run pytest tests/path/to/test.py::TestClass::test_method`
- Test with coverage: `uv run pytest --cov=minerva --cov-report=html`
- Type checking: `uv run mypy minerva`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Python 3.12+ compatibility required
- Follow PEP 8 and AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern in tests
- Use snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for classes
- Line length: 88 characters maximum
- Organize imports: standard lib, third-party, local
- Comprehensive docstrings for all functions (see existing format)
- Type hints required throughout the codebase
- Exception handling should be specific and well-documented
- Use pydantic for data validation and model definition

## Development Workflow
- Always check `.github/instructions/` for custom instructions at the beginning of coding
- After consulting custom instructions, refer to documentation in `docs/` directory and README.md
- Follow a document-first approach: create documentation as part of implementation planning and ask for user review
- Begin coding only after documentation review is complete
- Update documentation during implementation if discrepancies or improvements are identified
- Before creating a pull request, verify that documentation accurately reflects the implementation
