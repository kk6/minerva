# Update Knowledge Base

Analyze the current conversation for valuable insights and knowledge gained during coding tasks, then update or append relevant information to the CLAUDE.md file.

## Instructions

1. **Review Current Conversation**
   - Analyze the entire conversation history for valuable insights
   - Identify coding patterns, solutions, best practices, and lessons learned
   - Look for troubleshooting approaches, error resolutions, and workarounds
   - Note any technology-specific discoveries or configuration insights
   - Examine feedback provided during code reviews and subsequent improvements

2. **Read Existing CLAUDE.md**
   - Load and review the current CLAUDE.md file if it exists
   - Understand the existing structure and content organization
   - Identify sections that might need updates or new information
   - Note any gaps where new knowledge could be valuable

3. **Knowledge Classification**
   - **New Knowledge**: Information not present in CLAUDE.md that should be added
   - **Updated Knowledge**: Existing information that needs refinement or correction
   - **Enhanced Knowledge**: Existing information that can be expanded with new details
   - **Validated Knowledge**: Confirmation that existing practices work in new contexts

4. **Content Analysis and Preparation**
   - Extract actionable insights that would benefit future development work
   - Focus on:
     - Development workflow improvements
     - Technology-specific best practices
     - Common pitfall avoidance strategies
     - Performance optimization techniques
     - Testing and debugging approaches
     - Architecture and design patterns
     - Tool configuration and usage tips
     - Integration challenges and solutions

5. **CLAUDE.md Update Strategy**
   - **For New Content**: Add new sections or subsections as appropriate
   - **For Updates**: Modify existing content while preserving valuable historical context
   - **For Enhancements**: Expand existing sections with additional examples or details
   - **Maintain Structure**: Keep consistent formatting and organization
   - **Add Timestamps**: Include when knowledge was gained/updated for context

6. **Implementation**
   - Create or update the CLAUDE.md file with the identified knowledge
   - Use clear, descriptive headings and subheadings
   - Include practical examples where applicable
   - Add code snippets, commands, or configuration examples when relevant
   - Ensure content is searchable and well-organized
   - Include cross-references to related topics when helpful

7. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify all added content is accurate and actionable
   - Ensure formatting is consistent with existing CLAUDE.md style
   - **Duplication Detection**: Check that new content doesn't duplicate existing information
   - **Consistency Check**: Validate that updates improve rather than confuse existing content
   - **Transferability**: Confirm the knowledge is transferable to similar future situations
   - **Privacy Protection**: Exclude any sensitive information (API keys, passwords, personal data)
   - **Information Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact, frequently-used knowledge

8. **Documentation Standards**
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Include context about when and why certain approaches work
   - Add warnings about potential issues or limitations
   - Provide alternative approaches when applicable
   - Include relevant links or references when helpful

## Expected Outcomes

- CLAUDE.md file updated with valuable insights from the coding session
- New knowledge properly categorized and organized
- Existing content improved with recent learnings
- Enhanced documentation that will benefit future development work
- Preserved institutional knowledge that might otherwise be lost

## Content Management Guidelines

### Information Scope
- **Include**: Technical solutions, best practices, troubleshooting steps, configuration insights
- **Exclude**: Sensitive data, temporary debugging info, personal opinions without technical basis
- **Prioritize**: Reusable patterns, common pitfalls, performance optimizations, testing strategies

### Structure Maintenance
- **Respect existing hierarchy**: Follow current CLAUDE.md organization patterns
- **Use consistent formatting**: Match existing markdown style and conventions
- **Add appropriate sections**: Create new sections only when existing ones don't fit
- **Cross-reference related content**: Link to relevant sections when applicable

### Long-term Sustainability
- **Regular review prompts**: Include suggestions for periodic content review
- **Size management**: Recommend content splitting when sections become too large
- **Deprecation handling**: Mark outdated information for future removal
- **Version awareness**: Note when knowledge applies to specific tool/library versions
